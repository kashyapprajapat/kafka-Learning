# Kafka Learning Project  ðŸ“¥ðŸ”—ðŸ“¤

Apache Kafka is a distributed event-streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. It is widely used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Kafka's core strengths include high throughput, fault tolerance, scalability, and the ability to process data in real-time.

This project demonstrates the use of Kafka producers and consumers for message passing in distributed systems. Below are a couple of key images showcasing the project's setup and execution.
